# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Urban-Sound-Classification
Sound is one of the vital informatics indicating activities, events and even safety issues. UrbanSound database library (https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/index.html#welcome) is an open dataset source that offers several classes of sound data with audio files in each class. In this project, based on deep neural networks and using the UrbanSound database, the group aims to develop a framework to identify each sound class in urban areas accurately and improve classification performance.
